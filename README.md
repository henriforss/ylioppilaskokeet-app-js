# Finnish highscool exam app

This is a vanilla Javascript app for displaying names of Finnish highschoolers who have passed the highschool matriculation exam.

The app loads a csv-file with names and highschools, and parses it. It then allows the user to search either by name or highschool.

The Finnish highschool matriculation exam board supplies a similar list after every exam. The names and highschools in this list are fabricated.
